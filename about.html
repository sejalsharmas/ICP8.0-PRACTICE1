    <h1>Why do a programmer use Git & Github?</h1>
    <p>Git can provide an extremely detailed history of every change made to all the project’s files. This allows us to review changes, visualise the history using a graph view or revert our work to an earlier state.

        Git can facilitate distributed collaborative working. A range of options permits multiple developers to simultaneously work on the same project without impeding each other’s progress. Git can help us deal with the conflicts that might arise when we are working on the same set of files</p>
